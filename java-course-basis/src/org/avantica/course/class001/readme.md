* Variable scope.
* Ordering elements in class.
* Understanding Null.
* Primitive wrapper types.


#### Characteristics
* Object Oriented Language: It means all code is defined in classes and most
 of those classes can be instantiated into objects. Java allows functional
 programming, but within a class, but object oriented is still the main
 organization of code.
* Encapsulation: Supports access modifiers to protect data from unintended
 access and modification.
* Platform Independent: It gets compiled to bytecode. Benefit is that Java
code gets compiled once rather than needing to recompile for different
operating systems. This is also known as WRITE ONCE, RUN ANYWHERE.
* Robust: This is the major advantage over C++, Java prevents memory leaks,
it manages memory on its own and does garbage collection automatically.
* Simple: Java is intended to be simple than C++ in addition to eliminating
pointers and Java does not allow operator overloading.
* Secure: Java code runs inside Java virtual machine also knows as JVM.
This creates sandbox that makes it hard for Java code to do any damage to
  the computer that is running on.
